# ShoeFly.com_A-B_Test
This is the third project for the Codecademy Data Science intensive course. Here we do an A/B testing on the number of people clicking on the ads of a hypothetical website called ShoeFly.com
They have two different versions of an ad, which they have placed in emails, as well as in banner ads on Facebook, Twitter, and Google. They want to know how the two ads are performing on each of the different platforms on each day of the week.

# Main Objectives:
1. Get the percentage of users clicking on the ad from each source.
2. Get the percentage of users clicking on Ad A or Ad B.
3. For each group, get the percentage of users that clicked on the ad by day.

# Dependancies 
1. Pandas

# Additional comments
1. Each set of objective is analysed and saved as seperate csv file with the appropriate name. Refer to the comments in the python code to see the relevant details.
2. All the print commands are commented out. You can uncomment a specific print() to see the result in the terminal.
